> TaxPilot helps small businesses keep clean books and file taxes with confidence â€” without hiring an accountant.

This API powers onboarding, CSV imports, transactions, taxes (PIT/CIT/VAT), reports, and settings for tenants. Use Sanctum tokens for authenticated routes. Many download endpoints use expiring signed URLs for secure, time-limited access.
